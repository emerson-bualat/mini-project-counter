# Counter

## Overview

I created this website by following a tutorial by John Smilga, which provided the code for the entire website. I did not make any modifications to the code, and the website is a direct copy of the tutorial code.

## Features

- Reset Button: sets the counter back to zero.

- Decrease button: allows you to decrement the counter by one with each click.
